4.type /start
5.type /newbot
6.choose the name for the bot
7.type the username for the bot it should unique not have been choosen by others
8.after these steps completed success fully you will recieve a message from the BotFather that has your Bot's token copy it 
9.paste the token in the program where it is typed to be pasted 
10.run it (Using visual studio code better)
11.if it runs with error
12.you can use the bot 
13.if it does not response just close the telgram and open it
